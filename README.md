# Citrus Systems: TEST
Assignment for a job application by Citrus Systems.

## View website
You can view the site [here](https://krckyboy.github.io/test/).

## Stack
The only external package that was used in this project is [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) and the main purpose of it was to check if email and phone mumber is valid, pretty much.

SASS (SCSS) was used for styling for the ease of use and cleaner code.

No JavaScript frameworks were used in this project, only vanilla JavaScript.

Packages are used for compressing and prefixing CSS, but that's only for production, none of it required for development. To prefix and compile CSS, use the script: ``npm run compile:css``.

## What is this website about?
It's a simple form which is being visually updated by clicking on two navigation links/buttons, validated upon submit and once validation passes, the form processes the data and redirects to the success page.

The challenge of this assignment proves that you know how to:
⋅⋅* update the DOM upon different events firing up (by switching the navigation in the header, hovering, clicking, etc.)
⋅⋅* position elements properly, both in CSS and JS
⋅⋅* style custom radio buttons and checkboxes
⋅⋅* display a loading icon and when, letting the user know that the app is processing data
⋅⋅* validate form data and display errors if there are any
