The only external package that was used in this project is [validator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/validator) and the main purpose of it was to check if the email is valid, pretty much. I don't include the packages for compressing and prefixing CSS, since that's only used for production.

SASS (SCSS) was used for styling for the ease of use and cleaner code.

No JavaScript frameworks were used in this project, only vanilla JavaScript.
